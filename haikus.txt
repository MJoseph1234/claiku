for all the pizzas
the world has enjoyed so far
the last is not yet

this is a haiku
it counts my syllables here
it's pretty neat i think

dungeons and dragons
gotta kill that damn vampire
this is going to hurt

dungeons and dragons
bad guys are gonna get hit
i hope theres pie

this is a haiku
that I am writing to test
haiku c l i

I am writing tests
to see what model counts best
all the syllables

a cli haiku tool
to count syllables per line
in your great new poems

seasons pass
but claiku remains
write haikus
